I want to deepen my understanding of C and improve my overall coding skills in C. Also, I want to get myself more familiar with Virtual Machines. 
My expereinces of setting up Vagrant is very smooth as it is quite straightforward. My experience  in setting up Git takes longer because I was waiting for invitation on the repository. 
Overall it is a good learning experience to create directory and push directory to Git.
